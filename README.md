# AI-Programming-with-Python-Nanodegree
## Overview
### This repository contains two main projects completed as part of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program by Udacity.
#### Project 1: Dog Breed Classifier
##### In this project, you will build a Python application that uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network to classify images of dogs and predict their breeds. The project involves training an image classifier on a dog breed dataset and making predictions on new images.
#### Project 2: Flower Image Classifier
##### In this project, you will develop an image classification model that can identify different types of flowers. Using transfer learning, you will train a deep learning model on a flower dataset and build a Python application that can predict flower categories based on images.
